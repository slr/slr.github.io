# HEY THERE!

[my living dead blog](http://scary.tasty.sexy) was moved from Blogger here recently.

## ALL SYSTEMS NOMINAL

or it's going to be.

I want to have most of my stuff in English, Spanish and Russian.
so I did some mechanism to select language from ones which available on the page.
this selection saves to browser's local storage. then if selected language will be unavailable on next page
first available will be shown. language list is [en,es,ru] so you understand order of it's searching.

I suppose I'm not even average in English and surely beginner in Spanish
so please feel free to send pull requests with fixes of possible mistakes or translations.
